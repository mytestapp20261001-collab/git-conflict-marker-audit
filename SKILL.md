# Git Conflict Marker Audit

Use the public `audit(...)` API or documented CLI for this scoped read-only check. Read README.md before interpreting findings. Require the user to select the local input and root where applicable; do not broaden to unrelated files.

No input may be executed, rewritten, repaired, uploaded, or published. Do not follow symlinks, access credentials, change permissions, install dependencies, or contact remote sources. A requested audit does not authorize any follow-on action. Share reports only with the requesting user unless separately authorized; even filenames and hashes can be private metadata.

Python 3.12 standard library is sufficient; POSIX descriptor-relative no-follow support is required. Exit 0 means no findings within the documented policy, exit 1 means reviewable findings, and exit 2 means input failure or an incomplete audit. Never portray a pass as general security, semantic correctness, or format-compliance certification. Use the README examples and tests when changing code.
